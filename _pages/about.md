I am a graduate student in Computing Science at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html), Canada, under the supervision of Professor [Davood Rafiei](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~drafiei/). Currently, I serve as a research assistant at the AI and Database Lab, where I actively contribute to cutting-edge research initiatives.

My research interests span across Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Large Language Models. I am passionate about exploring innovative approaches to enhance language understanding and retrieval systems.

Prior to my graduate studies, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from [Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST)](https://www.sust.edu), Bangladesh.

## 🧭 🎓 🤖 Research Overview 
My research explores how large language models (LLMs) can understand and reason over structured and semi-structured data such as tables and databases—domains traditionally dominated by symbolic systems. I aim to build frameworks that integrate understanding, retrieval, and reasoning with the adaptability and generalization power of large language models. The unifying vision behind my work is to develop trustworthy, interpretable, and agentic AI systems capable of performing complex reasoning, grounding, and decision-making across structured data and natural language.
